## TP6 : Bezier surfaces
Today, we start working with surfaces, which means transition from 2D to 3D. We will use OpenGL for rendering, but donâ€™t worry if you have little or no experience with OpenGL; a wrapper class `Viewer` is provided. Adding a surface patch is as easy as calling
```python
viewer.add_patch(X,Y,Z)
```

First, we need to setup the required python packages `PyOpenGL` and `PyGLFW`. Do
```bash
cd GeoNum2017/
git pull
```
or, if you don't have the local repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeoNumTP/GeoNum2017.git
```
You should have the `TP6/`, but also the `viewer/` and two bash scripts: `setupPackages.sh` and `exportPath.sh`.
Run
```bash
# download and extract packages
./setupPackages.sh
# export python path
# note the extra dot in the beginning
. ./exportPath.sh
```

Afterwards, you can test the viewer with
```
python viewer/viewer.py
```

For the TP6, you can pass datanames and density directly as command line args:
```bash
python tp6.py  [simple,wave,sphere,heart,teapot,teacup,teaspoon]  [density=10]
```

### Representation
On the implementation level, the biggest difference between curves and surfaces is the representation we'll use.
Before, we used a single matrix to represent the whole curve -- each coordinate was stored in a separate column.
We can no longer do this for surfaces. Instead, we'll represent the surface using three matrices `X`, `Y` and `Z`,
one for each coordinate.

### Functions to modify
* `DeCasteljau` : implement the De Casteljau algorithm for surfaces.
* `BezierSurf` : compute Bezier surface points.

### ToDo
